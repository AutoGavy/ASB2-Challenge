- About the Counting System:
If you kill a drone, you will receive points. If you are hit by drones, you will lose points.
Different drone has different points.
If you hit or kill a marine, you will lose points.(Based on damage)
Playing in higher difficulty will get more points.

- Different difficulty has different settings:
1. Easy - Very fast drones + Prespawn 1
2. Normal - Vanilla brutal drone's speed + Prespawn 2
3. Hard - ASB2 + Prepsawn 1
4. Insane, Brutal - ASB2 (Prespawn 1 when in II)
*Prespawn is something like Carnage.

Some of above game settings are refered to ASBI PRO(Eerie-Eg) and jihad Server(wildcat).
